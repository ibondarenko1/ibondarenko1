🚀 Ievgen (Jack) Bondarenko

Security Architect & Compliance Advisor  
Designing Audit-Ready Security and Compliance Operations for Regulated Environments

This GitHub reflects my hands-on R&D work supporting my role as a Security Architect and Compliance Advisor.

Repositories here focus on prototyping, automation experiments, and reference architectures used to design and validate audit-ready, compliance-driven security solutions for regulated organizations.

🌐 About Me

I work at the intersection of cybersecurity, automation, and compliance engineering, with a focus on regulated environments such as healthcare, MSPs, and other compliance-driven organizations.


My goal is to simplify security and compliance requirements through practical automation and repeatable security architectures.

compliance readiness and control alignment (HIPAA, NIST, SOC 2)

automation of evidence collection, control mapping, and security documentation workflows

I’m interested in building tools that reduce complexity and make security processes more accessible and efficient.

🔧 What I’m Currently Working On

Currently developing an AI-driven compliance automation R&D initiative, focused on:

multi-agent architectures

automated evidence collection  
control mapping and audit traceability  
continuous compliance monitoring  
policy and documentation generation  
multi-agent architectures (internal orchestration)

This is an R&D direction I’m refining through real-world use cases with MSPs, clinics, and legal firms.

🎯 Focus Areas

cybersecurity architecture

AI-assisted workflow automation for compliance and security operations

compliance frameworks

SIEM/EDR integrations

risk & governance processes
