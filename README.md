🚀 Ievgen (Jack) Bondarenko
Security Architect & Compliance Advisor
Designing Audit-Ready Security and Compliance Operations for Regulated Environments

This GitHub reflects hands-on R&D work supporting my role as a Security Architect and Compliance Advisor. Repositories here focus on prototyping, automation experiments, and reference architectures used to design and validate audit-ready, compliance-driven security solutions for regulated organizations.


🌐 About Me
I work at the intersection of cybersecurity, automation, and compliance engineering, with a focus on regulated environments — healthcare, MSPs, legal firms, and other compliance-driven organizations.
My goal is to simplify security and compliance requirements through practical automation and repeatable security architectures:

Compliance readiness and control alignment (HIPAA, NIST, ISO 27001, SOC 2, PCI DSS)
Automation of evidence collection, control mapping, and security documentation workflows
Building tools that reduce complexity and make security processes more accessible and efficient


🔧 What I'm Currently Working On
An AI-driven compliance automation R&D initiative focused on:

Multi-agent architectures for compliance orchestration
Automated evidence collection and audit traceability
Control mapping and policy/documentation generation
Continuous compliance monitoring for MSPs, clinics, and legal firms


🎯 Focus Areas

Cybersecurity architecture & risk governance
AI-assisted workflow automation for compliance and security operations
SIEM/EDR integrations (Elastic | Kibana)
Compliance frameworks: HIPAA · NIST CSF · ISO 27001 · PCI DSS · SOC 2
