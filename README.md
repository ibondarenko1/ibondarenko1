🚀 Ievgen (Jack) Bondarenko

Security Architect • AI Automation • Compliance Engineering

🌐 About Me

I work at the intersection of cybersecurity, automation, and compliance engineering, focusing on how AI can simplify security requirements for small and mid-size organizations.

My background includes hands-on work with:

SOC / SIEM pipelines

security operations

compliance readiness (HIPAA, NIST, SOC2)

automation of routine security and documentation workflows

I’m interested in building tools that reduce complexity and make security processes more accessible and efficient.

🔧 What I’m Currently Working On

Right now I’m developing a stealth-mode AI-driven compliance automation concept, exploring:

multi-agent architectures

automated evidence collection

control mapping

continuous compliance monitoring

policy/documentation generation

This is an R&D direction I’m refining through real-world use cases with MSPs, clinics, and legal firms.

🎯 Focus Areas

cybersecurity architecture

AI workflow automation

compliance frameworks

SIEM/EDR integrations

risk & governance processes
