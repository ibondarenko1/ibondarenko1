🚀 Ievgen (Jack) Bondarenko
Founder — AI-Driven Compliance Automation Platform (Stealth Mode)

(Open to CTO co-founder for acceleration & launch)

🌐 About

I’m building a next-generation AI-powered compliance automation platform aimed at transforming how small and mid-size organizations achieve and maintain:

NIST 800-171 L1/L2

SOC 2 Type I / II

HIPAA Security Rule

Vendor Risk & Security Program Requirements

The platform leverages multi-agent AI orchestration to automate:

Gap assessment

Control generation

Audit evidence collection

Policy creation

Ticketing & remediation workflows

Continuous compliance monitoring

My goal is to make compliance faster, cheaper, and dramatically simpler for SMBs, MSPs, and regulated sectors.

🧭 Current Mission

Preparing a full concept package for accelerator submission (Y-Combinator / Alchemist).

Searching for a strong CTO co-founder to lead the engineering vision.

Building a validated problem-solution framework with early customers (clinics, law firms, MSPs).

Designing an AI architecture around multi-agent workflows for compliance automation.

🧩 What I’m Building

A SaaS platform where AI agents handle the heavy compliance work.
Core pillars include:

AI Gap Assessment Engine

AI Policy & Documentation Generator

Continuous Control Monitoring

Automated Evidence Collection

Risk Register & Remediation Tracking

Client-Ready Reports (Audit-Grade)

🏗 Background & Expertise

Before starting this venture, I spent years working in:

Domain	Focus
Security Architecture	Real-world SOC/SIEM/EDR deployments
Compliance	NIST, HIPAA, SOC 2 readiness frameworks
Automation	SOAR, LLM-agent orchestration, workflows
Risk & Governance	Policies, IRP, vendor risk, DRP/BCP

This background shaped the vision for the platform:
give all companies the compliance capabilities usually reserved for enterprise.

🛠 Tech Direction

The platform concept includes:

AI agents (orchestrator + specialist agents)

Evidence automation through secure connectors

SOC2/NIST mapping logic

Multi-tenant workspace design

Secure cloud architecture (Azure / AWS)

🤝 Looking to Connect With

Senior engineers interested in CTO/co-founder roles

Compliance professionals (ISO/NIST/SOC2 auditors)

MSP/MSSP leaders open to early pilot programs

Investors and accelerator partners
